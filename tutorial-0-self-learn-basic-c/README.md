# Tutorial 0: Basic C (Self-Learned)

> Tutorial 0 (Programmers count from 0)

### Tutorial 0

- Content: Basics of C
- Time: Before the first tutorial of your session
- Venue: Virtual
- Classworks: None (However, try the self-tests out)
- Homeworks: 3 Programming Assignments
- Homework Deadline: 27 Sep 2024 (Fri) 18:00

But we highly recommend you to finish the homework before your Tutorial 1

### Tutorial 0 Targets

* Understand basic C syntax and do simple control flows
* Knows how to run your C program
* Introduce you to programming concepts if you are not familiar yet

## Tutorial 0 Links

Not too Important:

* [01) Intro](01-intro.md)

Your first C program 

* [02) Where to run your C code](02-where-to-write-code.md)
* [03) Hello World](03-hello-world.md)

Basic Concepts of Programming

> Concepts that are less important but are still worth a quick read before moving on to the next part are marked with `*`

We will actually rediscuss these in your first tutorial, but please learn about them early, especially if this is the first time for you to write program.

* [04) Variables and Input-Output](04-variable-io.md) 
  * [Variables and Data Types](04-variable-io.md#variables-and-data-types)
  * [Input/Output: `printf` and `scanf`](04-variable-io.md#input-output-printf-and-scanf)
  * [Self-Tests](04-variable-io.md#self-test)


* [05) Operators](05-operators.md)
  * [Arithmetic Operators](05-operators.md#arithmetic-operators)
  * [Compound Assignment Operators](05-operators.md#compound-assignment-operators)
  * [Relational Operators](05-operators.md#relational-operators)
  * [Logical Operators](05-operators.md#logical-operators)
  * [Self-Tests](05-operators.md#self-test) (Intentionally before Increments and Decrements)
  * [Increments and Decrements*](05-operators.md#increments-and-decrements)


* [06) Rules and Extra Features*](06-rules-and-extra-features.md) 
  * Rules on variable naming, booleans, standard integers, casting, and `const` keyword

* [07) Control Flow](07-control-flow.md)
  * [`if - else if - else`](07-control-flow.md#if-else-if-and-else-statements)
  * [`switch`](07-control-flow.md#switch-statements)
  * [`while`](07-control-flow.md#while-loop)
  * [`do while`](07-control-flow.md#do-while-loop)
  * [`for`](07-control-flow.md#for-loop)
  * [`break` and `continue`](07-control-flow.md#break-and-continue)
  * [Self Test](07-control-flow.md#self-test) (Intentionally before Scope)
  * [Scope*](07-control-flow.md#scopes)


To further support your self-learning process, we provided some self-tests at the end of each materials to check your understanding.

## Some Notes for C Programming

> Note: To paste inputs/commands into the terminal, you can type Ctrl + V

> Note: If you copy an input into a terminal, Programiz may sometimes re-output your input, this is normal. 

> Note: If your code runs indefinitely and does not stop, you can stop it by typing Ctrl + C


## Homeworks

Please submit these homeworks before 27 Sep 2024 (Fri) 18:00

* [01) Swap Variables](homeworks/hw01-swap-variable.md)
* [02) Introduce Yourself](homeworks/hw02-introduce-yourself.md)
