# Homework Demo Arrangements

## Tutorial 0 and 1

### Online code submition

For tutorials 0 and 1, you can do all your work on your computer and submit it to Github classroom.

We will auto-grade the submitted assignments on the deadline There will be some hidden test cases after the deadline so make sure your code can handle all kinds of valid inputs.

You are always welcome to ask questions on Discord on the assignments if you are stuck on it.

## Tutorial 2 and 3

### Face to Face demo

Starting from tutorial 2, your work will require the use of the mainboard, so to complete your homework you'll have to come to us to borrow one. Attached below is a Google Sheets link where you can see the availability of team members. You can come borrow a mainboard and work at the lab whenever there is at least one member present. After you're done with your homework, please show a team member and they'll grade it for you.

Please also make sure you read the Regulations page in the file.
